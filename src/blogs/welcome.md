Hi there! Welcome to my very first blog post. This is my first blog entry in my life. I always wanted to start blogging since I learned about web development from my college days, on my personal website but never got around to it until now. So, here we are, finally marking the beginning of my blogging journey.

## Why Blog?

I've built many portfolio websites over the years, each time either enhancing my skills or trying out new trends going on in web development that people are building these days. I was also inspired by many developers and techies trying to make more modern, unique, slicky and eye-pleasing experience through code. And everytime I had given up on implementing a blog section on my websites. There's always been some inner voice telling me that I should start blogging, sharing my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge but I never took the plunge. Maybe it was fear of putting myself out there, or maybe it was just my laziness and procrastination getting the better of me. But sooner I realized that blogging is not just about sharing knowledge, it's also about personal growth, reflection, and an opportunity to understand myself better.

## About Me

I am a software engineer who loves to build and experiment with modern tools & technologies. I mostly do coding in C++, JavaScript, and Python. But these days, I am more into "English-prompt driven development". I enjoy solving DSA problems along with learning the internal structure and working of softwares from engineering perspective. Apart from coding, I love reading books, listening to music, and clicking pictures that intrigue my eyeballs. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/seuristic), [X](https://x.com/seuristic), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seuristic/).

## Topics Of My Blogs

In this blog, I plan to write mostly about my learnings in different domains related to DSA, system design, web development, UI design-related, and other modern technologies. This will also include my personal experiences, thoughts, and reflections on various topics that interest me.

## The Beginning...

I am very much excited to start this blogging journey and write a lot of interesting stuff here in the upcoming months (2026 and onwards). Is this my New Year's resolution? I guess so! There are alot of ideas brewing in my mind already to write about and share here. So, this is the beginning of something I really wanted to do for a really long time in my life before life takes over completely with its endless responsibilities and commitments.

Let's cheer for the good times ahead! 🚀
